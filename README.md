# Nuxt 3 Starter

This is an opinionated starter template for [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com). It is based on the what we use and love at [Input Studio](https://inputstudio.co).

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Features

Don't worry, if you don't need something, you can remove it. It faster to remove than to add.

- [x] 👓 Sass — CSS preprocessor
- [x] ✨ [Headless UI — UI components](https://headlessui.dev)
- [x] 📱 [Device — Device detection](https://nuxt.com/modules/device)
- [x] 🧹 Prettier — Code formatter

## Setup

Yeah, yarn is better than npm. But you can still use npm if you want.

# Go to the project directory:
cd <project-name>

```

## Production
